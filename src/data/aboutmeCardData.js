    content:`My learning journey is closely connected to my interest in video games, 
    which combine creativity and engineering. After graduating, I was honoured to work as a game designer. 
    During this role, I realised how valuable and engaging programming could be. Although I had some experience
    from my undergraduate studies, I felt a desire to deepen my skills, which led me to begin my self-study journey.`,

    title:'IN THE ERA OF AI',
    content: `I have witnessed the significant impact AI has had on the industry. However, there remains 
    a need for people with a good taste and a deep understanding of systems. One of the advantages of living in 
    this era is easier access to learning resources. AI provides quick start guides and makes solving problems 
    efficiently. I believe that the development of AI has made learning programming even more essential.`,

    title:'MY PERSONAL INTERESTS',
    content: `Besides programming, I am a sports enthusiast. I have developed a workout routine that includes 
    flexibility, strength, coordination, and a bit of cardio with the help from my Pilates practice once a week. 
    In addition, I have been continuously improving my English since studying abroad in 2022, and it remains 
    one of my strongest interests.`,
