    interest is in creation during my undergraduate studies. Then I realised I enjoy combining engineering and 
    art during my second major. I was honored to work as a game designer after graduation. While
    doing the job, I found it both necessary and attractive to learn programming. That's why I started the self-study.`,

    title:'UNDER THE ERA OF AI',
    content: `I have seen the effect AI has made to the industry, however, I also see there is still a need for 
    humans who have good tastes, who can really understand what's going on thus maintain a system. The advantage 
    of living in this era is that self-study becomes even easier. AI is good at providing a fast get-started
    guide on various tools, as well as summarising and translating code snippets and documentations. 
    It is the development of AI that makes learning programming more essential. `,
