        description: `This job at Lingxi Games was meaningful to me. I love good games. I learnt a lot
        about game design and development while I was there. However I left because of the management style, 
        the type of game being made, and my personal reason.
        When I was there, I designed a battle pass system and other features. 
        Analysed 480,000 player data entries to ensure fair difficulty curves.
        Produced detailed, pseudocode-style documentations for every design.
        Collaborated closely with programmers, UX designers, and game testers to ensure smooth development.`
